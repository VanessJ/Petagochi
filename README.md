# Llamagochi

Llamagochi is a web-based virtual pet simulation game that allows users to adopt and care for their own virtual pet. Users can interact with their pet by feeding, playing, and taking care of its needs, while earning points or rewards. The game features real-time updates of the pet's status, including hunger, happiness, and energy levels. The user interface is built using React, incorporating animations, sound effects, and interactive components to create an immersive pet care experience. Admins will be able to create, define and redefine types of pets, as well as to manage users and their accounts.
